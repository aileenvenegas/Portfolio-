# Aileen's Data Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains selected data projects developed using **Power BI** and **R Studio**.  
The goal of this portfolio is to showcase my approach to data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving.

All datasets used are generic, fictional, or anonymized and were adapted specifically for portfolio purposes.
